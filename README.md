# 🚀 Namaste React — My React Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React Learning Repository**! 🌱  
This project documents my journey as I learn and master **React.js** — understanding not just _how_ it works, but _why_ it works.

## 📚 About This Repo

This repo is a step-by-step journey of learning **React.js** from the ground up.  
I’m following a hands-on approach — building, breaking, debugging, and learning by doing.

**Here’s what you’ll find:**

- 🧩 Core React concepts
- ⚛️ Components, Props & State
- 🔁 Hooks & Lifecycle
- 🌐 Routing, APIs, and Data Fetching
- 💅 Styling (CSS Modules / Tailwind)
